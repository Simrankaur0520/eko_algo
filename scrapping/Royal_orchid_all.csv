Srinivas HR,5-Apr,This was a pleasant surprise! We had booked a king room and could get a spectacular view of Brindavan Gardens through their spacious balcony. You have through the day access to the gardens just a minute away which makes it worthwhile. …
Manu Mathew V,5-Mar,I went with my family for a 2 night stay. I must say the location of this hotel is really great. However the stay wasn't very pleasant and I wouldn't recommend it for the high price they charge. We booked a King room with garden view. …
Harikrishnan S,5-Apr,"Excellent location because it's near to a dam and garden. The garden is tooooo huge. The palace, which is now converted into a hotel gives you the feel which erstwhile Kings experienced, with modern amenities like AC, hot shower, room service and a splendid view with a very walkable garden, Brindavan. Go enjoy."

Breakfast spread is good with a live counter."
Ravishankar Rao,5-Apr,"Excellent place to relax, rewind and rejuvenate. One can spend the day at their  pool, play on life size chess board and get  fantastic massage at spa. Have a sip of your favorite drink sitting telaxed in the lobby facing towards the Brindavan Gardens, watching the greenery. Must stay place"
Ashokkumaran NK,5-Mar,Location is great. Great view from room balcony. Water flow in bathroom is too low. Can’t reach reception people most of the times.

Lohith Sk,5-Feb,"Food buffet is 850rs per person. But everything is just single choice. Starter, salad, curry, roti, main course etc. Everything is just 1 choice. Not at all worth. You get multiple choice in many other normal/luxury hotels in city for same price."
Ajay Bhati,5-Apr,A classy property with vintage vibes all around. Plush retro interiors throughout the property. Far from the city but great for people looking for a calm and a cozy stay for a day or two.

Magan Mehrotra,5-Apr,Great view. It is the only hotel at Brindavan gardens besides the government hotel. It will be even more value for money once the laser show at Brindavan gardens is started.
S S,5-Apr,"Overall had a good stay and comfortable rooms. Room service was great and so was service in general. Food options can be improved, particulalry jain style preparations. Food in the Buffett is limited and repetetive, they put garlic in pretty much all the side dishes. If they can improve the food spread and taste will rate better."
Raghu Cheluvaraju,5-Mar,"The location of the hotel is just perfect if you want to enjoy the Brindavan Gardens. The flip side of course, being that everything else in Mysore is quite a drive. …"

Anand Devsharma,5-Mar,"Inside Brindavan Garden. Nice balcony view. Good breakfast. But a rather old building with no elevator, cramped rooms, very basic services and no entertainment options for kids. Prices drop late; so booking in advance feels like a penalty."
