Sourabh Poddar,4/5,Not impressed with the taste. But it's okay with the price they offer their food. So if you have a normal budget with less expectations you can go have a go. We went to have lunch with a group of three and the bill was less then 1000 and the quantity was too good!!
Kavya kr,2/5,There are no veg hotels near SDM hospital except this one. All good items in this hotel is very costly. Not for middle class people. Ended up paying more
sai krupa,4/5,"The proverb looks can be deceiving is best applies for this place, situated in Mysore Road , outside look like any other ordinary lodge, the room inside was great, ambience and basic facilities were really good, food was delivered quickly but taste was only alright. For a 1-2 day stay this place is far more than sufficient"
piyush mani,1/5,"Dont go.

Very lethargic service …"
Raghavendra Kulkarni,5/5,Good quality and quantity. Coffee was really great. Service was quick for us as we ordered at the very beginning of entrance. Heavy rush during weekend.
Hanzal Khan,1/5,Literally the most horrible service with no lights in the service hall and absurd behaviour by the staff and the food is not worth the price.......
Rajarshi Choudhury,4/5,We stopped here for a breakfast pitstop on the way to madikeri. Although the ambience is definitely low key we found the rava dosa and masala dosa very delicious. The coffee also hit the right spot. The prices are very reasonable. The washroom can be cleaner.

chitra sulibhavi,1/5,"Waste of time and money. The idlis were very bad looked like they were made yesterday. When we told it to the waiter, absolutely no response.
